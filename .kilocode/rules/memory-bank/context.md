# Project Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Planning and Architecture Design

The project is in the initial planning phase. Comprehensive architecture plans have been created but no source code has been implemented yet.

## Recent Changes

- Created detailed architecture plans in `plans/architecture-plan.md` and `plans/architecture-plan-3d.md`
- Documented technology stack selection (Babylon.js 7.0+, TypeScript, Vite)
- Designed system architecture with component breakdown
- Planned responsive design strategy for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Outlined core game mechanics (Traffic, Tower, Economy, Wave, Health, Event systems)
- Designed PWA implementation approach

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize Project Structure**
   - Set up Vite project with TypeScript
   - Install Babylon.js 7.0+ and dependencies
   - Configure build system and development environment

2. **Implement Core 3D Systems**
   - Scene manager and initialization
   - Camera controller with responsive behavior
   - Lighting system
   - Basic mesh/material management

3. **Build Game Loop Foundation**
   - Implement game state management
   - Create entity system for traffic and services
   - Set up main game loop with delta time

4. **Implement PWA Features**
   - Service worker for offline caching
   - Web manifest for installability
   - Asset management for offline play
